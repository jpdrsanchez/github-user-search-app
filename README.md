- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

### What I learned


In this project I could learn a lot about using `typescript` in practice, in addition to a more complex setup of the project using tools such as `husk`, `lint-staged`, `eslint` and `prettier`.

### Continued development


I want to continue focusing on the study of `typescript` and the best patterns to develop with it, and I also want to start studying `unit tests` with `Jest`.
